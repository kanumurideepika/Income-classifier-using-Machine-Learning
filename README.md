# Income-classifier-using-Machine-Learning
In this project, different Machine learning classification algorithms like KNearestNeighbors, logistic regression,decision tree and RandomForest are used.

A subsidy company gives subsidy to individual based on their income.
Basing on a large dataset of attributes jobtype,educationtype,marital 
status,occupation,race,gender,capital loss,capitalgain,hoursperweek,
And nativecountry ,I developed an income classifier system using KNN 
NEIGHBOURS with accuracy of 88.45%. So, with the input of above 
attributes we can classify their income as lessthan 50000 or greaterthan 
50000.
